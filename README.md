Privacy preserving K-means clustering system for 2 party computation in Python by utilizing 
Pytorch and Facebookâ€™s secure computation library Crypten.

The model utilizes restructured mathematical operations to make them secure with the help of
the Oblivious Transfer protocol, which guarantees the preservation of the privacy of individual datasets.
